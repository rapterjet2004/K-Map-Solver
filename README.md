# Karnaugh Maps Introduction:
Karnaugh maps or K-Maps are a method of simplifying Boolean Algebra expressions. The Boolean expressions are first created in a truth table before being transferred onto a K-Map where each cell represents the output for each expression. Basically the original truth table's Canonical Representation. Valid groupings of 1's can form groups together, that can then be reduced by eliminating redudant inputs, for the end result of a simplified expression. Put together, the final result is a optimal expression that uses minimal logic. This is useful in the real world for minimizing the amount of logic gates needed for a circuit to function.

# K-Map Solver
Instead of having to create and simplify the groups manually, K-Map Solver provides a fast a quick way to get a simplified expression from a truth table. Simply plug in the points and press solve. 

# Notes: 
Default config has AB on x-axis and CD on y-axis

Uppercase letters = input

Lowercase letters = not input

Example: 0110 >>> aBCd
